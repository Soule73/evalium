# E2E Tests Environment Configuration

This file contains the credentials and configuration used for E2E testing.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES

1. **Never commit this file to version control** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use test-only credentials** - Never use production credentials
3. **Update regularly** - Keep in sync with your seeded test data
4. **Team sharing** - Share this file securely via password manager or secure channel

## Configuration Variables

### Base URL
- `BASE_URL`: The URL where your application is running (default: http://localhost:8000)

### User Credentials
The credentials must match your database seeders:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` & `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin user credentials
- `TEACHER_EMAIL` & `TEACHER_PASSWORD`: Teacher user credentials
- `STUDENT_EMAIL` & `STUDENT_PASSWORD`: Student user credentials

### Test Configuration
- `TEST_TIMEOUT`: Global timeout for each test (in milliseconds)
- `EXPECT_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for expect() assertions (in milliseconds)

## Usage

These credentials are automatically loaded by:
- `utils.ts` - Provides helper functions to access credentials
- `fixtures.ts` - Injects credentials as fixtures in tests
- Setup files (`auth.*.setup.ts`) - Uses credentials for authentication

## Example Usage in Tests

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../Helpers/fixtures';

test('example test with credentials', async ({ page, adminCredentials }) => {
    // adminCredentials is automatically loaded from .env
    console.log(adminCredentials.email); // admin@example.com
});
```

## Updating Credentials

If you change your seeded test data:
1. Update the corresponding values in this `.env` file
2. Re-run the authentication setup: `yarn test:e2e -- --project=setup-admin`
3. Test files will automatically use the new credentials
