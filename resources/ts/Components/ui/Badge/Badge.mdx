# Badge

A small status indicator component for displaying labels and states.

## Overview

The Badge component is used to display status information, labels, or counts in a compact, visually distinct format. It supports multiple color variants to convey different meanings.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@evalium/ui';

function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <>
            <Badge color="success">Active</Badge>
            <Badge color="error">Error</Badge>
            <Badge color="warning">Pending</Badge>
        </>
    );
}
```

## Colors

Available color options with their typical use cases:

- `success` - Positive states (green) - completed, active, approved
- `error` - Negative states (red) - failed, error, rejected
- `warning` - Cautionary states (yellow) - pending, warning, in review
- `info` - Informational states (blue) - info, new, updated
- `gray` - Neutral states (gray) - default, inactive, draft

## Common Use Cases

### Status Indicators

Use badges to show the current state of items, tasks, or processes.

### Counts and Notifications

Display numerical values like unread messages or notification counts.

### Labels and Tags

Categorize or label content with color-coded badges.

## Examples

### Status Colors

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Success} />
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Error} />
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Warning} />
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Info} />

### Application States

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Active} />
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Inactive} />
<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Pending} />

### All Types

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.AllTypes} />

## Props

<Controls of={BadgeStories.Success} />

## Best Practices

- Use consistent colors across the application for similar states
- Keep badge text short and concise (1-2 words)
- Use `success` for positive outcomes
- Use `error` for failures or critical issues
- Use `warning` for items requiring attention
- Use `info` for neutral information
- Use `gray` for disabled or inactive states
- Don't overuse badges - they lose impact when everything is badged
